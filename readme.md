# Learning Go with Tests

This repository is my personal journey to learn the Go programming language using the Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach outlined in the excellent resource [Learn Go with Tests](https://quii.gitbook.io/learn-go-with-tests/).

## Purpose

This repository serves as a hands-on practice space for me to apply the concepts and exercises from the "Learn Go with Tests" guide. I will be committing code regularly as I progress through the lessons, showcasing my learning process and the evolution of my Go skills.

## Structure

The repository will be organized based on the chapters and exercises in the guide. Each chapter will have a dedicated folder containing relevant code, tests, and any additional notes or reflections.

## Progress

I will update this README file with my progress and key takeaways as I complete each chapter. Feel free to follow along, provide feedback, or offer suggestions!

## Disclaimer

This repository is primarily for my personal learning. While I strive for accuracy and best practices, there may be errors or room for improvement. I welcome constructive feedback and discussions.

## Let's Go!

Let's embark on this exciting journey of learning Go with tests! ðŸš€
